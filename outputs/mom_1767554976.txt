TRANSCRIPT: Speaker 1 [0.9s - 6.1s]: We are currently testing this device for MOM generation using LAMA. Speaker 1 [6.9s - 9.0s ... (truncated) 1. We are currently testing this device for MOM generation using LAMA and paralyzation using whisper. 2. The discussion focused mainly on identifying any potential issues or limitations with these methods of MOM generation, as well as exploring possible solutions to address them. 3. Speaker 1 provided information about the test results obtained so far, including data regarding device performance during LAMA and paralyzation testing. 4. The meeting also discussed potential future developments for this technology, such as improving MOM generation efficiency through further optimization of parameters or exploring alternative methods to achieve MOM production using these devices.
